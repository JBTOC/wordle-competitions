[17/06/2024, 12:52:35] Johnny Haverty: Proposed Wordling rules ... maybe you do this already and anyway it will be self policed but I propose:
Max 60 seconds from start to finish
No looking at any prior entries from others ... share your entry on WA before opening WA.

Whaddyethink?
[17/06/2024, 13:09:57] Lorcan Kavanagh: Ok with not looking at other entries but time limit is too short.
[17/06/2024, 13:20:56] John O’Connor: Why the rush.
[17/06/2024, 13:22:49] Gerry: 3 mins should be loads of time
[17/06/2024, 13:28:57] Keith Morris: I think looking at others and knowing what you need to make it in is good. Kinda like a matchplay putt to half a hole. No point in leaving short..
[17/06/2024, 13:29:53] Keith Morris: 3 min time limit sounds good
[17/06/2024, 13:40:02] Giller: No problem with not looking at prior entries....wonder about the time limit...I generally take a couple of attempts, then if I am not getting anywhere I go away and think about it before finishing....but happy to go with the flow.
[17/06/2024, 13:44:27] Johnny Haverty: Ok 3 mins.
Looking at others is rude and encourages late entries. 
Keith you cropped up in a dream I had the other night. In a packed Kehoes. I  helped you to make it to the door to get sick. Sounded like the money python fat man. Returned to bar where barman told me we'd all had enough. I couldn't see ... was getting around  the place by sound only.

Does that help seal the deal on rule #2?
[17/06/2024, 13:44:49] Johnny Haverty: Monty
[17/06/2024, 13:46:34] John O’Connor: Have Protestants taken over? Making us go faster at our leisure? Agree with not gleaning info from others answers.

[17/06/2024, 14:02:07] Keith Morris: Very funny
[17/06/2024, 14:02:41] Keith Morris: I'm happy with any rule changes. I still need to play today though. Work has kept me from wordle
[17/06/2024, 14:03:07] Fitz: I haven’t been looking at other’s entries. 3 minutes is plenty if the muse is with you, otherwise like Giller I sometimes walkway for a while.
[17/06/2024, 15:27:24] Keith Morris: I don't look at the actual entries, just what the score was eagle or birdie or bogey or whatever. Just to be clear. Entry coming..

[17/06/2024, 16:35:04] Johnny Haverty: Losing.  All the time.  Greatest inspiration known to man.
[17/06/2024, 16:40:49] Johnny Haverty: Plus rumours from nameless sources that certain nameless competitors know other competitors 'seed' words and can therefore figure out stuff that losers never could
[17/06/2024, 16:46:56] Lorcan Kavanagh: I shared that perspective with Gerry but never abused as you can see from my 100% run of 0 skins - but it’s possible for those with devious character.
[17/06/2024, 17:46:00] John O’Connor: It’s two euros every 18 days. 
And note I changed my seed word. 
My favourite part of wordle sharing is the pattern. Everyone posts art. Would hate to lose that. 
And none of that explains the speed. 
Too chaotic?
[17/06/2024, 19:30:34] Johnny Haverty: OK WO never mind  (we'll never get to see the Picassosque patterns from the proposed changes)

Who’s in favour of a new format, only 9 holes, 3 points for winning a hole, 1 for being involved in a half? Same prize system.

And 1150 was halved in 4, not won.

So it’s 2 skins today, with a score board correction needed.

[10/10/2024, 12:00:37] Giller: The Giller 3-ball has been out over the last few weekends and have played a variation of skins.   If you win a hole outright you get 2 skins, if two people draw the hole they get 1 skin each...otherwise its a rollover with 4 skins (or 2 each for shared win) moving to the next hole...worth a try?  What it did was reward "pars" and penalise "honourables"
